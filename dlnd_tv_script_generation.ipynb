Although your choices aren't perfect, they are reasonable and should result in a system that meets the overall requirements of this project - with just one or two slight exceptions.

This can cause the network to get stuck, where the network picks the same set of words again and again. Please try adding some randomness to choosing the next word so that this scenario doesn't occur.

    "# The TV Script is Nonsensical\n",
    "It's ok if the TV script doesn't make any sense.  We trained on less than a megabyte of text.  In order to get good results, you'll have to use a smaller vocabulary or get more data.  Luckily there's more data!  As we mentioned in the beggining of this project, this is a subset of [another dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data).  We didn't have you train on all the data, because that would take too long.  However, you are free to train your neural network on all the data.  After you complete the project, of course.\n",
